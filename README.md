Community Service Manager
=========================

Manage your community service schedules with multiple volunteers easily.
You simply create community service dates by using the [Event Organiser
plugin][1] and let the volunteers apply for the dates by themselves. You can
configure automatic notiftications for upcoming and unattended community
services.
